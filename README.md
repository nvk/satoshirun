# Satoshi Run
An annual proof of reservers on Bitcoin central services

Every January 3rd, users withdraw all Bitcoin they may have sitting on exchanges, centralized wallets, etc for 24hrs. This is a great way to ensure those services actually have the reserves they claim.

All you have to do:

1. Withdraw to your own hardware wallet.
2. Wait 24hrs...
